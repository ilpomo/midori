# midori: a simple trading system

> Code has to run like the human brain, trillions of individual neurons firing off messages to each other, a massively 
> parallel network with no central control, no single point of failure, yet able to solve immensely difficult problems. 
> And itâ€™s no accident that the future of code looks like the human brain, because the endpoints of every network are, 
> at some level, human brains.

Midori is a trading system that allows you to connect to your favourite exchanges to download both historical intraday 
and real-time data; it lets you also create custom trading strategies, backtest them and run them live. It tries to do 
it in the most simple, essential and effective way.

## Features

### Integrated Data Acquisition Pipeline

Connect to your favourite exchanges and download both **historical intraday** (trades, OHLCV 1m+) and **real-time** 
(orderbook L1-L2<sub>-L3</sub>) data.

### Trading Strategy Builder

Build your custom trading strategies starting from one of the available templates and combine your favourite technical 
indicators to generate your trading signals.

### Interactive Dashboard

Visualize your trading strategies while you are building them, tweak indicators parameters and see how they adapt in 
price chart. This will allow you to easily filter all those indicators parameters that when combined would never 
generate any trading signal, reducing by a lot the backtest to run.

### Backtesting Suite

Proper backtesting is hard, but `yolo_mode=True`. Define a gazillion parameter combinations, massively backtest them all 
by parallelizing the computation<sub>and cooking your hardware, lol</sub>, visualize the performance 
<sub>normal</sub>distribution and choose the one you prefer<sub>it's the most frequent one, right? Right?!</sub>.

### Paper Trading

You, pussy.

### Live Trading

Deploy them live without needing to configure any third-party service, directly from your notebook, workstation, private 
server or cloud solution. The entire platform is extremely efficient and scalable, probably you will not need expensive 
hardware for even the most complex strategies.

### Private Telegram Bot

Set up a private Telegram bot that acts as a notification system for the platform's trading activity and as a remote 
control interface:
- Activate or deactivate any trading strategy.
- Activate or deactivate notifications for API updates.
- Tweak strategies parameters on-the-fly, while live trading without rebooting<sub>Microsoft can't, just 
  saying</sub>.

## Installation

To get started with Midori, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ilpomo/midori.git
   cd midori
   ```

2. **Create a new Virtual Environment**:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - On Windows:

       ```sh
       .\venv\Scripts\activate
       ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

       ```sh
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Project**:

   - Navigate to the `init.py` file in your code editor.
   - Right-click the `init.py` file and select 'Run'.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies, specified in the `requirements.txt` file:

- **Polars**: dataframes powered by a multithreaded, vectorized query engine, written in Rust.
- **PyZMQ**: Python bindings for ZeroMQ, a high-performance asynchronous messaging library.
- **python-telegram-bot**: a library to build Telegram bots.

Ensure you have the latest versions of these dependencies installed.
